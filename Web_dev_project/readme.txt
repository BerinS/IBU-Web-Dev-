Foundations of Frontend Web Development - Project 1
Berin Surkovic - IBU

For my Foundations of Frontend Web Development project, I decided to make a portfolio website. This site is a showcase of what I can do.

I went for a simple, easy-to-use layout with everything on one page. There are sections like "About Me" and a portfolio to browse through, with easy-to-use filtering and a sleek contact form.

Technologies used to create the site:
-Bootstrap and jQuery https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/
-Tilt.js (JS library for creating 3D tilt effects) https://micku7zu.github.io/vanilla-tilt.js/
-Isotope (JS library for filtering the portfolio) https://isotope.metafizzy.co/filtering
-Ionic icons https://ionic.io/ionicons
-Sass 

As for what you'll see on the site, there's a lot of projects I've worked on over the course of many years. Each project has a short description, so you can get an idea of what it's all about.
With future project developments, each portfolio piece will get its own .html page, filled with additional information and images.
